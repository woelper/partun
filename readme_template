# partun

**par**tial **un**archival tool.

[![Rust](https://github.com/woelper/partun/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/woelper/partun/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

This is a very specialized command line utility which allows partial decompression of archives, for example in memory or diskspace constrained systems.
Partun can also be used where available methods (for example in 32 bit environments and very large zip files) fail to extract files.
